- 🔭 I'm currently working on an indie game (2D platformer with RPG elements) and learning how to build fully functional websites from start to finish:
Developing the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -> Building the backend with Python and frameworks like Django, Flask, or FastAPI -> Setting up the interaction between the frontend and the database -> Testing and debugging -> Deployment.
